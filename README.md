# Shopifex

Shopifex is an example [Fireside](https://github.com/ibarakaiev/fireside)
component that exposes core e-commerce functionality as an Ash domain.
It is currently not versioned and is not recommended for installation, besides
experimenting with Fireside. It will later be augmented to include cart and
order functionality before release.
